# Team Aggrement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

## Weekly meetings

## Meeting "location"

## Primary method of communication

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

let everyone know 12 hours prior on the wechat group.

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

We'll set our own deadlines before the due date, which we will all adhere to.

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

The team aims to produce high-quality deliverables that exceed the minimum requirements for this project. We will agree on an internal deadline, usually one or two days before the official deadline, so we can have a chance to communicate and make adjustments needed. Team members will hold each other accountable by checking in on each other to ensure our individual work reflects the high standards set by the team. Those who fail to achieve the expected work quality or do not meet the deadlines will have conversations with the rest of the team to improve upon their work and make up for any missing elements. Lastly, we will assign roles and responsibilities depending on the tasks at hand so that we can work efficiently and productively. 

We felt that we needed to assign different roles based on the specialties and abilities of the team members. Break up the entire project so that each member gets a separate part of the task. This clarifies the responsibility of team members for their tasks and strengthens each member's sense of responsibility. In addition, we plan to make it clear in the agreement that the scope of responsibility for the task includes communication with each other, and the team members must have a macro awareness of the entire project, which means that the team members cannot "disappear" or stop communicating after completing their part! You need to communicate with your members after you have finished your work and start thinking about how to connect your part to the other part.Team members need to communicate with other team members continuously after completing their personal part of the work and be responsible for connecting their own work content to the overall project.

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!


## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<soltoffbc\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
